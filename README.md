# Image Resizing

This project harnesses the capabilities of Python and Flask to dynamically resize images. Upon the submission of an image, the user is presented with an interactive interface, implemented using HTML, where they can specify the desired dimensions for the resizing operation. This seamless integration of Python, Flask, and HTML empowers users to conveniently tailor images to their specific size requirements, enhancing the overall user experience and utility of the application.
